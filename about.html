            <p>Hi! I’m Ty and I am a junior at Brown University from Tucson, Arizona. I study computer science and I love design and technology and am obsessed with data visualization in particular. I think a lot about presenting complex information in ways that anyone can understand and improving data salience. I also am interested in both philosophy and decision making and find UX research as a way to improve my understanding of the often unintuitive ways that people think and interact with the world. Recently, I’ve also become interested in entrepreneurship and intrigued by its parallels with design thinking. <br><br>When I’m not in school or working on projects, you can probably find me playing soccer, hiking, or reading. </p>
